During spring break, I dedicated my time to preparing for the CompTIA Network+ certification exam. Rather than taking the week off, I focused on building my foundational knowledge in networking through structured self-study.

I made measurable progress by completing approximately 14% of the Jason Dion video course, which has proven to be a valuable resource for understanding core networking concepts. In addition to the video series, I explored several Network+-related podcasts on YouTube and Spotify. These supplementary materials have helped reinforce my learning and provided additional context to the topics covered in the course.

As part of my preparation, I also took my first practice assessment. While my initial score was 43%, it is a baseline to build from rather than a setback. The experience gave me a clearer picture of the areas where I need improvement. I remain confident that I will be well-prepared to pass the exam with continued study and practice.

Day 1 back from Spring break has its unique challenges. The vent under which I sit is so cold that it makes focusing difficult. Despite the cold, the GOAL 750 remains. I am glad we focused on Layers 1 and 2—Physical and Data Link. What is becoming more clear are terms like:
Physical - bits 1s and 0s. Wired - Wireless - Antenna 
Wired—Coax—Twisted Pair—Fiber—I need to understand the connection points better for fiber. The ST-SC SL and MTR make no sense to me—absolutely none!
As I understand their role in attenuation, the role of media converters, amplifiers, and repeaters becomes clearer. All these tools assist with signal loss.

Understanding the transmitter and receiver is becoming clearer. Their communication method must be considered for data to pass through the layers. Someone has to talk, and someone has to listen. I appreciate that this industry is about improving processes. I know Mr. Darrell is joking when he talks about aliens and dope smokers coming up with these new advances; however, seeing the improvements from polling to token to arcnet to  chaos theory is fascinating.  All these changes are to get more data faster.

I get fuzzy when we started talking about the Fiber Ethernet Standards. That is super confusing, and I need to watch a few more videos on this subject to better understand.

Overall, it was a good day. I was permitted to move my seat. I will explore that option tomorrow to see if that will allow me to focus better.
