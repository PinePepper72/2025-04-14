Over the course of spring break, I dedicated my time to preparing for the CompTIA Network+ certification exam. Rather than taking the week off, I focused on building my foundational knowledge in networking through structured self-study.

I made measurable progress by completing approximately 14% of the Jason Dion video course, which has proven to be a valuable resource in understanding core networking concepts. In addition to the video series, I explored several Network+ related podcasts available on YouTube and Spotify. These supplementary materials have helped reinforce my learning and provided additional context to the topics covered in the course.

As part of my preparation, I also took my first practice assessment. While my initial score was 43%, I view it as a baseline to build from rather than a setback. The experience gave me a clearer picture of the areas where I need improvement, and I remain confident that with continued study and practice, I will be well-prepared to successfully pass the exam.
